## Firebase Security Rules
To enable write access for the population script, you'll need to set up Firebase security rules. Here's a basic example:

```javascript
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    // Allow read access to all documents
    match /{document=**} {
      allow read: if true;
    }
    
    // Allow write access for authenticated users
    match /{document=**} {
      allow write: if request.auth != null;
    }
  }
}
```

## Running the Application

1. **Start the development server**:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

2. **Access the application**:
   Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser

3. **View the data**:
   - Home page will show categories, videos, and books
   - Navigate to /books for all books
   - Navigate to /videos for all videos
   - Use search and filters to find specific content

## Context Providers
The application uses several React contexts to manage Firebase data:

- `FirebaseVideosProvider`: Manages video data and operations
- `FirebaseCategoriesProvider`: Manages category data and operations
- `BookProvider`: Manages book data and operations (Firebase-based)
- `AuthProvider`: Manages user authentication
- `LanguageProvider`: Manages internationalization

## Real-time Updates
The application uses Firebase's real-time listeners to automatically update the UI when data changes in the database.

## Troubleshooting

### No Data Showing
If no data appears on the home page:
1. Check the browser console for Firebase connection errors
2. Ensure Firebase security rules allow read access
3. The app will automatically add sample data if no content exists

### Permission Errors
If you see permission errors:
1. Set up proper Firebase security rules
2. Ensure your Firebase project is properly configured
3. Check that the API key and project ID are correct

### Video/Book Not Loading
If specific videos or books don't load:
1. Check that the `isPublic` field is set to `true`
2. Verify that the document exists in the correct collection
3. Check the browser console for specific error messages

## Next Steps
1. Set up Firebase Authentication for user management
2. Configure Firebase Storage for file uploads
3. Set up proper security rules for production
4. Add more sample content as needed
5. Implement user-specific features (favorites, history, etc.)
